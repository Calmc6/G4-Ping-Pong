# G4-Ping-Pong
This is Group 4's Project for COP4331 with Turgut.

This repo includes two versions of the game: A version that includes Bluetooth functionality and a version that does not, so that you can test it for yourself without a second device. The version without Bluetooth can be played locally on the same screen. Both versions include all project requirements.
